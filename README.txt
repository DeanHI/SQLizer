This is my attempt to create psuedo-ecommerce appliance retailer.
I will upload 1 ready schema consisting of 3 different tables, representing different classes of appliances, all with MSRP prices, fictitious amounts sold, profit made, picture of appliance and other descriptions.
Updating the table will occur via the SQLite 3 builtin module. Updating the table will be made by the user, which is like an admin for managing the store inventory.
Also I will print out the SQL commands performed as sort of a tutorial for the admin to learn SQL.
Finalized schema creation, then created separate .py file to be imported into main app .py file. Will not start work on rendering queried results via jina2 etc. into HTML templates.
